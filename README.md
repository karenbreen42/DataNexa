## Features:
- **Data Ingestion:** Easily ingest data from various sources such as databases, files, APIs, and streaming platforms.
- **Data Processing:** Perform data transformations, cleansing, and enrichment using advanced processing capabilities.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Utilize statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and predictive modeling for insights generation.
- **Visualization:** Create interactive visualizations and dashboards to communicate insights effectively.
- **Scalability:** Scale effortlessly to handle large volumes of data without compromising performance.
- **Security:** Ensure data security and compliance with robust security features and access controls.

## Getting Started:
1. **Installation:** Install DataNexa using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install datanexa
    ```
2. **Initialization:** Initialize DataNexa in your project directory:
    ```bash
    datanexa init
    ```
3. **Data Ingestion:** Ingest data into DataNexa from your desired sources:
    ```python
    from datanexa import DataIngestion

    ingestion = DataIngestion()
    ingestion.from_csv('path/to/data.csv')
    ```
4. **Data Analysis:** Analyze your data using DataNexa's analytical tools:
    ```python
    from datanexa import DataAnalytics

    analytics = DataAnalytics()
    analytics.describe_data()
    ```
5. **Visualization:** Visualize your data for insights:
    ```python
    from datanexa import DataVisualization

    visualization = DataVisualization()
    visualization.plot_histogram('column_name')
    ```

## Usage:
```python
from datanexa import DataIngestion, DataAnalytics

# Ingest data
ingestion = DataIngestion()
ingestion.from_csv('path/to/data.csv')

# Analyze data
analytics = DataAnalytics()
analytics.describe_data()
